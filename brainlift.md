## Purpose

The basic premise is that I spend a lot of time waiting for claude code to finish doing agentic work.

I find it difficult to do multiple context switches. I want a simple, mindless game to play while waiting for claude.

By hooking into claude code hooks, I should be able to integrate the status of claude to the game, and thereby pause it.

For developers looking for a way to stay engaged and mentally sharp while waiting for code to compile, "flow" games can be particularly beneficial. Brandin recommends games that push the boundaries of what a video game can be, such as the puzzle-like Braid, the narrative-driven What Remains of Edith Finch, and the playful Untitled Goose Game. [00:15:48, 00:16:34, 00:17:13] These types of games can provide a quick, enjoyable, and mentally stimulating break that aligns with the psychological benefits discussed.
In essence, the argument is that video games, when viewed as a valid leisure activity, can offer significant psychological rewards. For a developer, playing a simple game during a short pause is not a waste of time but a way to refresh their cognitive state, maintain a sense of autonomy, and experience a small dose of competence and enjoyment, potentially leading to a more focused and productive state when they return to their primary task.

The concept of "flow" was developed by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
It describes a state of complete immersion in an activity, where you feel energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment. In gaming, this is often called being "in the zone." This state is achieved when there's a perfect balance between the challenge of the task and the skill of the player, avoiding both boredom and anxiety.

- I like games with a LOT of sprites / characters -> Example: Rome Total War, just massive armies fighting it out

### Flow states

Key elements for achieving a flow state in games include:

- Clear goals and immediate feedback
- A balance between challenge and skill
- A sense of control over your actions
- Intense concentration on the task at hand
- A distorted sense of time

Research suggests that entering a flow state during activities like gaming can have positive effects that are relevant to a developer's work:

- Reduced Anxiety and Depression: The intense focus required for flow can reduce self-rumination and symptoms of anxiety and depression.
- Increased Well-being: In healthy individuals, flow states induced by video games can increase subjective well-being.
- Improved Performance: Studies have shown a correlation between being in a flow state and better performance in the game, suggesting a link between this mental state and optimal functioning.

#### Examples of Flow-Inducing Games

- Rhythm and Music Games: Games like Thumper use audio and visual cues to create a meditative and hypnotic experience.
- Puzzle Games: The classic example is Tetris. The increasing speed and need for quick decisions can easily lead to a flow state. Tetris Effect is a modern version praised for its flow-inducing qualities.
- Action and Arcade-Style Games:
  - Fast-paced shooters like DOOM Eternal are often cited as prime examples of inducing flow through their intense and demanding gameplay loops.
  - Skateboarding games like the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series put you in a flow state with their time-based goals and combo mechanics.
  - "Auto-shooter" or "bullet heaven" games like 20 Minutes Till Dawn and Vampire Survivors can create a hypnotic and focused state as the on-screen chaos escalates.
- Creative and Exploration Games:
  - Minecraft allows for a flow state as players set their own goals, which can grow into larger, more engrossing projects.
  - Superflight is a simple game about flying through procedurally generated mountains, where the focus is on the satisfying feeling of movement and taking risks.

### Task switching

The human brain is not designed to multitask effectively. Instead of processing multiple tasks simultaneously, our brains rapidly switch between them, incurring what is known as a "switch cost." This cognitive cost can manifest as lost time, increased errors, and mental fatigue, ultimately reducing productivity by up to 40%.

- Cognitive Load and "Attention Residue": When we switch from one task to another, a part of our attention remains stuck on the previous activity.
- Brain Mechanics: Neuroscientific studies show that task switching involves complex processes in the prefrontal cortex. The brain must shift goals, deactivate the "rules" of the previous task, and activate the rules for the new one.

#### How to Minimize Task-Switching Problems

- Single-Tasking and Deep Work: The most straightforward approach is to focus on one task at a time. Allocating uninterrupted blocks of time for complex tasks, a concept known as "deep work," can significantly boost productivity.
- Task Batching: Grouping similar tasks together
- Time Management Techniques: Pomodoro, time-blocking
- Minimize Distractions
- Mindfulness and Breaks

#### What to Do While Waiting for Something in Your Main Task

Short waiting periods, like waiting for code to compile, present an opportunity for a "micro-break." Research shows that even very short breaks can be beneficial.[17] However, the type of activity you engage in matters.

- Relaxing, Non-Work-Related Activities:
- Go for a short walk: Even a brief stroll can clear your mind, reduce stress, and enhance creative thinking.
- Breathing exercises or meditation: These can help quiet the mind, reduce anxiety, and improve focus.
- Stretching: This can relieve physical strain from sitting for long periods.
- Engage in a non-demanding creative hobby: Activities like solving a puzzle, reading a book, or listening to a podcast can provide a mental escape.
- Low-Cognitive-Load Productive Tasks:
- Organize your workspace: De-cluttering your physical or digital space can create a sense of calm and save time later.
- Plan ahead: Use the time to organize upcoming tasks or jot down ideas.
- Catch up on quick communications: Writing a quick thank-you note or personal message can be a productive use of a few minutes.

What to Avoid During Short Breaks:

- Work-related micro-breaks: Interestingly, some research suggests that engaging in other work-related tasks during a micro-break can actually increase fatigue and decrease well-being.
- Mindless scrolling: While tempting, mindless scrolling on social media is often cited as a significant waste of downtime. Opting for a more intentional and restorative activity is generally more beneficial.

**Playing a low-cognitive-load, engaging, flow-based game during a forced micro-break like a compile time is a highly effective way to manage the "waiting" period. It's superior to both passive waiting (which can lead to mind-wandering and context loss) and switching to another high-cognition task (which incurs a heavy switch cost).**

The Case FOR Gaming During Compile Times

- Productive Context Switching: Instead of your brain drifting aimlessly and creating "attention residue" on random thoughts, you are performing a controlled context switch to a non-work-related, structured activity. This makes it easier to disengage from the game and re-engage with your code once the compile is finished, as the game's context is completely different and self-contained.
- Maintaining Cognitive Engagement (The Right Kind): Passive waiting can feel like a "lull" that drains mental energy. A simple game keeps your brain engaged in a state of "active rest." It occupies the parts of your brain that might otherwise get distracted by email, social media, or ruminating on a complex bug, without taxing the specific problem-solving circuits you need for coding.
- Harnessing the Power of Flow: Achieving a flow state, even for a few minutes, is highly restorative. It's characterized by effortless focus and a positive emotional state. A short burst of flow can act as a "cognitive palate cleanser," reducing stress and frustration from the main task and allowing you to return with a refreshed perspective.
- Avoiding the "Empty Time" Trap: Unstructured waiting often leads to unproductive habits like doomscrolling or starting a new, complex task you can't possibly finish. A designated "compile game" provides a default, positive activity that fills that void constructively.

#### Picking the right game

- Extremely Low "Switch Cost": The game must be instantly playable. No long loading screens, complex menus, or mandatory tutorials. It should be launchable and in-game within seconds.
  Pausable and Instantly Droppable: The core design must not punish you for quitting abruptly. When the compile finishes, you should be able to close the game immediately without losing significant progress or feeling frustrated. Session-based games are perfect.
- Low Cognitive Load: The game should be intuitive and rely on muscle memory or simple pattern recognition, not complex strategic planning, resource management, or reading. It must not compete for the same mental resources as programming.
- Clear, Simple, and Satisfying Feedback Loop: The actions should be simple (e.g., move, jump, place block) and the feedback immediate and rewarding (e.g., points, cleared lines, satisfying sound effects). This is the engine of the flow state.
- Scalable Sessions: The game should be just as engaging for a 30-second compile as it is for a 5-minute one.
