A simple linear running game with 3D graphics.

The player controls their mob's location by swiping (or mouse dragging) left and right.

As the mob runs it passes through gates that have mathematical operations that increase or decrease the number of people in the mob.

Running towards the mob are monsters. The mob has guns that shoots the monsters.

The user collects coins from killing the mob and then can use this to buy upgrades between games.

Tech stack:

- vite + React + tailwind (for any normal html)
- three js for canvas rendering
- mobx for state management
- typescript

- lucide icons
